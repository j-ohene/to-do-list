# to-do-list
This repo is a to do list adapted into to a luggage list of what to pack for a tropical vacation. 
This was achieved through the use of html and css. There are three bramches including the main branch, the feature base structure, along with background image.
The feature base structure included the basic class build of html and and css elements to create the articles in a list format. from there, a checklist was 
created along with the ability to hightlight the item the user will select by hovering their curser over it.
The last branch was background image which contained the background image that covered the section including the article. There are also a few final changes made with spelling and the colors of h2 following the addtion of the image
